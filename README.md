# 🎨 AI Art Curation Platform

## 📌 Overview

This project leverages machine learning to curate visual artworks based on consumer preferences. It analyzes uploaded artworks, classifies them by style and emotion, estimates fair prices, and presents curated selections tailored to individual users.

## 🎯 Goals

- Curate art using visual and stylistic analysis.
- Predict artwork prices based on data-driven models.
- Provide intelligent, meaningful art recommendations.
- Support artists by showcasing their work effectively.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🧠 **Art Classification**: Automatically identifies style, technique, and emotional tone.
- 💰 **Price Prediction**: Estimates fair prices using size, medium, artist profile, and market trends.
- 🎨 **User Curation**: Matches consumer preferences with curated artwork.
- 👩‍🎨 **Artist Dashboard**: Interface to upload and manage artworks.
- 🖼️ **Consumer Experience**: Explore tailored art recommendations with detailed metadata.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Components

| Task                     | Model/Technique                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Image analysis           | CNNs (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)    |
| Style/emotion detection  | CLIP (OpenAI), VGG + custom labels   |
| Price prediction         | XGBoost, Linear Regression           |
| User preference learning | Embeddings, Collaborative Filtering  |

## 🗂️ Data Sources

- Artist-submitted artwork + metadata (size, technique, etc.)
- Auction records and online gallery datasets
- External sources: Artsy, Kaggle datasets, SaatchiArt

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Artist uploads** artwork with metadata.
2. **ML pipeline** classifies artwork and predicts pricing.
3. **User sets preferences** (e.g., style, emotion, color palette).
4. **Curation engine** generates personalized artwork selections.
5. **Consumer receives** curated results with rich artwork details.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI or Flask
- **Frontend**: React or Next.js
- **ML Frameworks**: PyTorch / TensorFlow / scikit-learn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Storage**: AWS S3 / MinIO
- **Deployment**: Docker, CI/CD pipelines

## 🔒 Optional Features

- 📈 Explainable AI (Why this art was recommended?)
- 🖼️ AR preview to see artwork in user environments
- 🧾 Support for NFTs or digital-only assets

## 🚧 Roadmap

- [ ] Define and collect training datasets
- [ ] Train MVP classification and pricing models
- [ ] Build REST API endpoints for upload and recommendation
- [ ] Create frontend for artists and consumers
- [ ] Integrate full ML pipeline with the web app
